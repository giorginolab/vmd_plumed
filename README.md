Plumed-GUI
==========

Toni Giorgino  


A collective variable analysis tool for VMD
------------

The PLUMED-GUI collective variable analysis tool is a plugin for the [Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD)](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
software that provides access to the extensive set of collective variables (CV) defined in the PLUMED. It allows you to:

- analyze the currently loaded trajectory by evaluating and plotting arbitrary CVs
- use VMD's *atom selection* keywords to define atom groups and ready-made templates for common CVs
- export the CV definition file for use in MD simulations
- prepare reference files for RMSD, path-variable, native contacts, etc.
 
The code is hosted on GitHub at
[giorginolab/vmd_plumed](https://github.com/giorginolab/vmd_plumed).




Installation
------------

First, you likely want PLUMED 2's *plumed* executable in your path: 
see [INSTALL-PLUMED-FIRST.md](doc/INSTALL-PLUMED-FIRST.md). The GUI
also supports older PLUMED 1.3's *driver*.

Second, you may want to update PLUMED-GUI to its latest version,
rather than using the one distributed with VMD. See instructions
in [INSTALL.md](doc/INSTALL.md).
